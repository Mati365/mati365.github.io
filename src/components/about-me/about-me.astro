    Hi, I'm Mati. 🐱 My cat says I'm good at debugging, but only when the bug involves opening his treat jar.

    With 10 years of experience, I've mastered the fine art of pretending I know what I'm doing while wrangling code and occasionally mowing the lawn.

    I've worked with various clients from startups to large corporations.
